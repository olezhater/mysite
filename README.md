Hi there!

Currently, I am working as a Product Designer for a major retail company, where I focus on a mobile application used by millions of users for grocery delivery. In my role, I prioritize user needs by analyzing product metrics and user feedback to enhance the app's user flow and overall experience. I like generate new ideas and concepts to continuously improve user experience.  My work experience includes designing interfaces for banking products used by 15 million users in fintech, including customer support and configuring bank services.
